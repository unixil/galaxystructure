* feedback in low mass galaxies in the early universe
** feedback: during the star birth, evolution and death, they will
release large quantity energy and momentum into the gas surrounding
the sites star formation. This process is called feedback. It will
inhibit further star formation by heating the gas or blow them
away. Without feedback we should find more stars than we find now.
** C1
*** the overall star formation density of the university
*** the reironization
*** outflow property are scaled with mass and star-formation rate.
*** low mass galaxy as sources of ironized photons which are cause of
ironization and the feedback help the escape of these photons.
*** lyman line are able to indicate the existence of feedback but are
not able to map the velocity of the outflow.
*** mass of gas ejected from the star-formation area are approximatly
equal to the mass of the stars the gas will form.
*** star formation rate peak: $z\sim 2-3$
*** outflow impact: relation of heavy element content and mass of the
galaxy
*** some gas between and surround the galaxy are metal enriched
*** efficients of stellar formation needs to be explained, halo mass
bigger than $10^{12} M_{sun}$ may be due to feedback, and halo mass
lower than $10^{12} M_{SUN}$ may be due to formation and evolution of
massive stars.
*** now we can only simulate the outflow by computer and it does not
do quite well
** observation of outflow at high redshift
